Hi all! Welcome on board!!!!

This is the second best place on the internet to learn PyTorch and Deep Learning (the first being the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials)). 

In this tutorial, we will cover:
>01 Neural Network Basics    
>02 PyTorch Basics 
>03 Workflow: Build NN with PyTorch
>04 Regression
>05 Classification 
>06 Computer Vision
>07 Mathematical Simulation: Numerical Solution For SDE/PDE

Before we start our jouney to masters, let's think about a question:

What do you want out of your life?

Well, this sounds kinda abstract and vague. Here, I wanna share a quote from _[Principles](https://www.principles.com/)_ by Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates (as well as my role model). At the very beginning of the book he wrote:

>_Think for yourself to decide: 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achiee #1 in light of #2...and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking availabel to you._
---
While our answers may differ, there's one thing we should agree on: everyone is on his/her own journey of life. This journey can be analogized as a voyage down the river of time, which carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. The key to survival is making reliable predictions and bets.

Think about it. If we could (in theory) accurately foretell the future - which gifts will excite your beloveds most, which six lottery numbers will make you a billionaire, etc. - you will be the GOD (of your own life).
---
And this is NOT impossible. Still in theory, with infinite amount of information, and with infinitely fast thinking speed, we can achieve this. Well, however, the reality is, we mankinds have our limits, both physically and mentally. Scientists have measured and found that:

>- an average person living today processes as much as 74 GB in information a day (that is as much as watching 16 movies);
>- the information-processing capacity of the human brain during a specific task is no more than about 60 bits/sec.

But what about your laptops? A MacBook with M3 Pro chip can process 150 GB/sec!!!! (Notice the big G!!!)
---
So, here is the idea. What about throwing all the available information (in the forms of data) to the super brain - the computer chips, letting them process the information and thus make predictions for us? 

As Dalio said, should we "systemize our decision making" , i.e. use the algorithms to make belivibility-weighted decisions, we can increae our odds of being right and winning the gambles. This is thrilling. 
---
And here comes the brilliant innovation of Neural Network (NN). As is suggested by its name, NN, a type of heuristic algorithm, is trying to mimic human brains with computer chips. The way it processes information and makes predictions is exactly how human neural network works (we'll elaborate this part in [01 Neural Network Basics](...)). 
---
So, at the end of our journey together, you can expect to be a "Prophet" - by getting the gist of making reliable predictions and decisions. 

__BON VOYAGE AND LET'S GOOOOOOO!__
