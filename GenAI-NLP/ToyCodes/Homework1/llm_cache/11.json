The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished watching this movie: \"Uff\u0085OK, it ended, what a relief!\" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a B-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it not an excuse to be so bad! I've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! This one got nothing of it! The plot is hilarious, it almost seems like an \"American guide about how to transform ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult\"\u0085 I don't know if the Chinese tale present in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the \"damage\" is even worse! The production is just horrible, a plain zero (What \"special effects\" are those?). There's no suspense. The supposed \"tension scenes\" are a complete failure. The acting is not better; and what about the dialogs? Oh my God! A movie which has for several times dialogs just like: \"I will pass there later, OK? Is that alright? \u0096 OK, alright. - OK? \u0096 OK, alright, bye then\"\u0085 I'm sure it doesn't deserve more than a 1/10 score!<br /><br />Too bad to be true!",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n\n   - Positive keywords (pos):  \n     None explicitly mentioned in the review. The review is overwhelmingly negative, focusing on poor quality, horrible production, bad acting, unentertaining plot, etc.\n\n   - Negative keywords (neg):  \n     nightmare, relief, pain, bad, low cost, nothing of it, hilarious (used sarcastically), ridiculous, horrible, plain zero, no suspense, failure, not better, bad dialogs, not deserving, too bad.\n\n2. From the review, the overall sentiment is very negative. There are no positive indicators.\n\n3. Calculation:\n\n   - Count of positive keywords (pos): 0\n   - Count of negative keywords (neg): approximately 13-15, based on the highlighted negatives.\n\n4. Compute the ratio:\n\n   - pos2neg = 0 / 15 = 0.0\n\n5. Final classification:\n\n   - Since the ratio is 0, indicating no positive keywords found and predominantly negative ones, the review should be classified as negative.\n\nFinal output:\n\n```python\nTag(is_pos=False, kws=KeyWord(pos=[], neg=['nightmare', 'relief', 'pain', 'bad', 'low cost', 'nothing of it', 'hilarious', 'ridiculous', 'horrible', 'plain zero', 'no suspense', 'failure', 'not better', 'bad dialogs', 'not deserving', 'too bad']), pos2neg=0.0)\n```",
