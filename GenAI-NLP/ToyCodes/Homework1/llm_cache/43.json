Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: I have never seen this movie on its own, but like many others who have already commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible 70s television schlock. But someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a $125 million flop called The Island.<br /><br />And to the person who asked whether there were ANY good movies made in the 70s, I want to remind her that it was a golden age for American film with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese first coming into their own. Not to mention little things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract keywords:**\n\n   - Positive keywords: \n     - \"golden age\", \"creative\", \"Star Wars\" (implying quality movies in the 70s) \n   - Negative keywords:\n     - \"really terrible\", \"schlock\", \"flop\", \"never seen as an episode of MST3K\" (implying poor quality or disappointment)\n\n2. **Count the occurrences:**\n   - Positive keywords: 3 (\"golden age\", \"creative\", \"Star Wars\")\n   - Negative keywords: 4 (\"really terrible\", \"schlock\", \"flop\", \"never seen\")\n\n3. **Calculate ratio:**\n   - Positive to negative ratio = Number of positive keywords / Number of negative keywords = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\n4. **Decision rule:**\n   - Usually, if the ratio is greater than or equal to 1, classify as 'positive'.\n   - If less than 1, classify as 'negative'.\n\nIn this case, 0.75 < 1, indicating the review is more negative.\n\n---\n\n**Final classification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"golden age\", \"creative\", \"Star Wars\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"really terrible\", \"schlock\", \"flop\", \"never seen\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.75\n}\n```",
