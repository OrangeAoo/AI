  "prompt_input": "\n    You are given a movie review text and you need to classify it as 'positive' or negative.\n    Applying chain-of-thoughts, first extract keywords in the reviews, \n    then calculate the positive-to-negative keyword ratio. Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: This was an excellent movie! I saw this at the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic, and it won an award there. This is the first film I've ever seen from Jan (the director), and I was impressed. It's a great story about love and family. The movie has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama, and suspense all in one. I will not give away any of the plot, but this is a well-made film, and I would watch it again if I had the chance! The cinematography/editing is great, the film simply flows, and the characters are warm, and they are the kind that one can relate to. I hope you can enjoy this film as I did. If anyone knows where I can find this in the United States, or if they plan on releasing it on DVD anytime soon, please let me know!!",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \n     - excellent movie\n     - impressed\n     - great story\n     - great balance\n     - well-made film\n     - flow\n     - warm characters\n     - enjoy\n     - well-made\n   - Negative keywords:\n     - None explicitly mentioned\n\n2. Count the positive and negative keywords:\n   - Positives: 9 (excellent, impressed, great, great, well-made, flow, warm, enjoy, well-made)\n   - Negatives: 0\n\n3. Calculate the ratio:\n   - positive_to_negative ratio = positives / max(negatives, 1) = 9 / 1 = 9.0\n\nSince the ratio is strongly skewed toward positive keywords, the overall sentiment is positive.\n\nFinal classification:\n```python\nTag(is_pos=True, kws=KeyWord(pos=[\"excellent\", \"impressed\", \"great\", \"great\", \"well-made\", \"flow\", \"warm\", \"enjoy\"], neg=[]), pos2neg=9.0)\n```",
