Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: ***SPOILERS*** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens, Julie Strain. Amelia getting her husband Hal, Edward Albert, to get a promotion at his job at the Giger & Greengrass law-firm over the more deserving Larry Barnes, Larry Poindexter, who happens to be married to Erica has her cast a spell on Hal causing him to lose control of his car and end up almost killing himself.<br /><br />Larry finding out about Erica's attempt on his best friend Larry's life has a violent fight with her causing Erica to fall from the balcony to her death. It's when Larry goes back to his ex-wife Carol, Rochelle Sanson, that things begin to really heat up, emotional and sexually. The wicked Amelia tries to have the dead spirit of Erica take over Carol's body and end up murdering Larry who she holds as being responsible for her husband Hal's injury that left him permanently confined to a wheelchair.<br /><br />Not much of a story but lot's of cheese and soft-core action with poor Larry getting manipulated by Amelia through the resurrection of Erica who plans to kill him the first chance he turns his back on her. Amelia is a bit whacked out herself not exactly knowing who is and who isn't a threat to her. Amelia even gets her poor and innocent gardener Stan, Michael Parks to first lose him family in a bloody house invasion break-in, then his mind, by being accused by the police as being the murderer, and finally is life, by getting blasted by Ameila herself. As he's made to runs into the Reynolds' house, under her control, as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal. <br /><br />Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of \"Sorceress\" and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is. Stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn't have to suffer,like those of us watching, through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie.<br /><br />It becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of \"Sorceress\" that all this shenanigan's on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie. The ending is about the best thing, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast, that one can say about the film.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \"Miss Blair\", \"well-endowed woman cast\", \"ending is about the best thing\"\n   - Negative keywords: \"poor Larry\", \"cheese\", \"soft-core action\", \"bad the movie\", \"brainless and mind-numbing\"\n\n2. Count of positive and negative keywords:\n   - Pos: Miss Blair, well-endowed woman cast, ending is about the best thing \u2192 3\n   - Neg: poor Larry, cheese, soft-core action, bad the movie, brainless and mind-numbing \u2192 5\n\n3. Calculate the ratio:\n   - Positive-to-negative ratio = 3 / 5 = 0.6\n\n4. Final decision:\n   - Since the ratio is less than 1, indicating more negative keywords, the review overall leans negative.\n\nBased on this, the final classification is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"Miss Blair\", \"well-endowed woman cast\", \"ending is about the best thing\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"poor Larry\", \"cheese\", \"soft-core action\", \"bad the movie\", \"brainless and mind-numbing\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.6\n}\n```",
