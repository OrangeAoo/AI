Whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved, I would imagine that The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit, but unless you are a historian or a poet, who cares.<br /><br />The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine, and the other is Vera who was his first love. One romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot, now grown up they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is set during the war. Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war. While he is away, Vera starts to fall for Thomas again, and Kathrine has fallen out of love with him. She is also carrying another man's child. Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig returns<br /><br />As you can see, it is a very soap operatic plot, and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner, with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue. But all is not lost yet. For a non- Hollywood production, I think that the Edge of Love is about as stylish a picture as one can get. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances, Hollywood production or not. Some of it has to do with being set during the war, which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, a bit like Atonement. this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to Joe Wright's Oscar nominee, but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression. Things are okay at the start and finish, but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested, unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story. <br /><br />I doubt if The Edge of Love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer, but is a good film to check. it might even make a good date night movie, considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract keywords**:\n   - Positive keywords: \"stylish\", \"more dimensional\", \"more intelligent\", \"emotional conflict\", \"convincing\", \"better\", \"good film\", \"good\" (implying positive aspect), \"smarter\"\n   - Negative keywords: \"soap operatic\", \"slow\", \"sappy dialogue\", \"drab\", \"less about\", \"requires stable pacing\", \"middle section is tested\", \"not very impactful\", \"unless you are deeply rooted\"\n\n2. **Count positive and negative keywords**:\n   - Positive count: 7 (stylish, more dimensional, more intelligent, good film, good, smarter, emotional conflict)\n   - Negative count: 6 (soap operatic, slow, sappy dialogue, drab, requires stable pacing, tested middle section)\n\n3. **Calculate ratio**:\n   - Ratio (pos / neg): 7 / 6 \u2248 1.17\n\n4. **Final decision**:\n   - Since the ratio is greater than 1, the review leans towards positive sentiment.\n\n**Final classification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": true,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"stylish\", \"more dimensional\", \"more intelligent\", \"good film\", \"good\", \"smarter\", \"emotional conflict\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"soap operatic\", \"slow\", \"sappy dialogue\", \"drab\", \"requires stable pacing\", \"tested middle section\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 1.17\n}\n```",
