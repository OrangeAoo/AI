    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords indicating positive sentiment:\n   - \"shows all of those techniques and skills\"\n   - \"teaches many and many lessons\"\n   - \"performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills\"\n   - \"strongly recommend watching this movie\"\n   - \"seek out hints and tips given so easily\"\n   \n2. Extract keywords indicating negative sentiment:\n   - The criticism of \"gaijin\" (foreigners) being told only \"nihonjin\" (Japanese) could perform well, implying a negative view of that attitude.\n\nSince the overall tone of the review is highly positive, emphasizing the movie\u2019s instructive value, performance, and a strong recommendation, the positive keywords outweigh the negative ones.\n\nNow, count and calculate the positive-to-negative keyword ratio:\n\n- Positives: 5 (based on the identified positive phrases)\n- Negatives: 1 (the initial criticism, but less emphasized overall)\n\nRatio = positive / negative = 5 / 1 = 5.0\n\nSince the ratio is significantly greater than 1, the review is predominantly positive.\n\n**Final classification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": true,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\n      \"shows all of those techniques and skills\",\n      \"teaches many and many lessons\",\n      \"performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills\",\n      \"strongly recommend watching this movie\",\n      \"seek out hints and tips given so easily\"\n    ],\n    \"neg\": [\n      \"gaijin have been told only nihonjin could achieve the excellent performance\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 5.0\n}\n```\n\n**Decision: True (positive review)**",
