The choice of weapon is well, plain ridiculous, are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit man/terrorist would select that for an assasination?<br /><br />The whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away. None of that survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA/FBI/army vs the evil terrorist plot, we've all seen 1000 times before.<br /><br />But of course the movie company's MBA's realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang, so the answer is ......Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a crippled plot. They assume the American audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesperson (where is France on the map afterall) so it has be an American!<br /><br />Another example of a movie defiled by the boardroom.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract Keywords:**\n\n- Positive keywords:  \n  - \"mesmerised\" (indicating admiration or positive feeling towards Bruce Willis and the original movie)  \n  \n- Negative keywords:  \n  - \"dumb it down\"  \n  - \"formula ridden hype\"  \n  - \"treats its audience like a bunch of idiots\"  \n  - \"plain ridiculous\"  \n  - \"tired old\"  \n  - \"crippled plot\"  \n  - \"defiled\"  \n\n2. **Count Positive and Negative Keywords:**\n\n- Positive count: 1 (\"mesmerised\")  \n- Negative count: 7 (\"dumb it down\", \"formula ridden hype\", \"idiots\", \"ridiculous\", \"tired old\", \"crippled plot\", \"defiled\")  \n\n3. **Calculate ratio (positive-to-negative):**\n\nRatio = positive / negative = 1 / 7 \u2248 0.14\n\n4. **Final decision based on ratio:**\n\nTypically, a ratio closer to 1 indicates a balanced or positive review, whereas a very low ratio (like 0.14) indicates a predominantly negative review.\n\n**Final classification:** Negative (False)\n\n---\n\n**Structured output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"mesmerised\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"dumb it down\", \"formula ridden hype\", \"treats its audience like a bunch of idiots\", \"plain ridiculous\", \"tired old\", \"crippled plot\", \"defiled\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.14\n}\n```",
