Which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer GENIUS of Agatha Christie: the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness. In addition to her stories, the excellent production values, beautiful locations, wonderful music, top-notch acting, elegant directing, etc. are the reasons for this series' success and timelessness - and all those virtues are present in \"After the Funeral\". A word of advice: be alert right from the start - there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence! There are some quite unnerving moments as well, in contrast to the peaceful-looking English-countryside locations, and some small touches of humor. A must-see for mystery buffs, and just a very good film in general. (***)",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \"sheer GENIUS\", \"appreciate\", \"success\", \"timelessness\", \"excellent\", \"beautiful\", \"wonderful\", \"top-notch\", \"elegant\", \"virtues\", \"success\", \"must-see\", \"very good\"\n   - Negative keywords: \"unnerving\", \"clues dropped all over the place\" (could be neutral, but generally hints at suspicion or alertness), \"small touches of humor\" (neutral)\n   \nGiven the overall tone, the review is predominantly positive, emphasizing the story's brilliance, production quality, and being a must-see.\n\n2. Count positive and negative keywords:\n   - Positives: 13 mentions (sheer GENIUS, appreciate, success, timelessness, excellent, beautiful, wonderful, top-notch, elegant, virtues, success, must-see, very good)\n   - Negatives: 2 mentions (unnerving, clues dropped all over the place \u2013 somewhat negative as it hints at suspense but not necessarily a negative comment)\n   \n3. Calculate the ratio:\n   \n   Ratio = positive / negative = 13 / 2 = 6.5\n\n4. Final decision:\n   \n   Since the positive-to-negative ratio is significantly greater than 1, and the overall tone is enthusiastic and praise-filled, we classify as 'positive'.\n\n**Final classification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": true,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"sheer GENIUS\", \"appreciate\", \"success\", \"timelessness\", \"excellent\", \"beautiful\", \"wonderful\", \"top-notch\", \"elegant\", \"virtues\", \"success\", \"must-see\", \"very good\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"unnerving\", \"clues dropped all over the place\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 6.5\n}\n```",
