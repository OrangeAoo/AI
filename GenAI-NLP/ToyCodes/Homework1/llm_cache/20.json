Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. It tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. My reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. Also, there's no horror here. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating...I am not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). Hell...there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist or juvenile...I prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. And that tired as all hell \"reality TV show gone wrong thing\"? It's been done before and a lot better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. I also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because \"reality TV is taking over\". Did someone from the past post that with a time machine? Are you freaking kidding me? This thing is trash...and not in a fun way.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n\nPositive keywords (pos): Generally, the review is negative, but for the purpose of extraction, look for words with positive connotations.\n- None explicitly positive are clearly mentioned.\n\nNegative keywords (neg):\n- sold a bill of goods\n- not the movie's fault\n- no comedy\n- never gets more than a chuckle\n- rolling my eyes\n- tired material\n- no horror\n- no tension\n- very little blood\n- not much violence\n- zero nudity\n- tired as hell\n- bad\n- trash\n- not in a fun way\n\n2. Count the keywords:\n\nPositive keywords: 0\n\nNegative keywords: 14\n\n3. Calculate ratio:\n\nSince no positive keywords are present, the ratio of positive to negative is 0.\n\n4. Final decision:\n\nBased on the ratio (0 positive : 14 negative), which is clearly very negative, the review should be classified as negative (False).\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [],\n    \"neg\": [\n      \"sold a bill of goods\",\n      \"not the movie's fault\",\n      \"no comedy\",\n      \"never gets more than a chuckle\",\n      \"rolling my eyes\",\n      \"tired material\",\n      \"no horror\",\n      \"no tension\",\n      \"very little blood\",\n      \"not much violence\",\n      \"zero nudity\",\n      \"tired as hell\",\n      \"bad\",\n      \"trash\",\n      \"not in a fun way\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.0\n}\n```",
