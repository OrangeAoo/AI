Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: A Roger Corman rip-off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget. All of the special effects were originally used in \"Battle Beyond the Stars\", and I suspect a fair amount of the props, costumes and sets were re-used from other sources as well. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a recycling project. Third-rate \"Star Wars\" junk wasn't needed then or now.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Negative keywords: \"rip-off\", \"zero budget\", \"special effects\", \"re-used\", \"recycling\", \"junk\", \"third-rate\", \"not needed\"\n   - Positive keywords: There are no explicitly positive keywords in the text.\n\n2. Count the positive and negative keywords:\n   - Pos: 0\n   - Neg: 8\n\n3. Calculate the positive-to-negative keyword ratio:\n   - ratio = 0 / 8 = 0\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Since the ratio is zero and the language is predominantly negative, the review indicates a negative sentiment.\n\n**Final decision: False (not positive)**\n\nHere's the formatted output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [],\n    \"neg\": [\"rip-off\", \"zero budget\", \"special effects\", \"re-used\", \"recycling\", \"junk\", \"third-rate\", \"not needed\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.0\n}\n```",
