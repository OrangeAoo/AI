Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: At first sight this is yet another highschool anime with lots of excuses for 'fanservice', but there is a lot more going on. The 'fanservice' is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual), and most importantly there is a clever plot that ties all the episodes together, and that poses some interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it is certainly worth watching the series again in chronological order.<br /><br />The series is worth watching carefully, because there are a lot of casual hints in there that foreshadow and explain things, plus a good number of in-jokes about other series, anime and other.",

    "response_text": "First, let's extract the keywords from the review. \n\n**Positive keywords:**\n- \"more going on\" (implying depth)\n- \"a lot of interesting questions\"\n- \"a clever plot\"\n- \"worth watching\"\n- \"worth watching carefully\"\n- \"foreshadow\"\n- \"explain things\"\n- \"good number of in-jokes\"\n- \"series\"\n\n**Negative keywords:**\n- \"yet another highschool anime\" (implying commonality or lack of uniqueness)\n- \"excuses for 'fanservice'\" (potentially negative or dismissive tone)\n- \"tired cynic\" (can be negative, implying the main character is tired or cynical, possibly a negative trait)\n- \"non-chronological\" (not inherently negative but could be considered a complexity or negative aspect depending on context)\n\nNow, considering the tone:\n- The review recognizes some typical elements but emphasizes the depth, clever plotting, and additional layers (hints, in-jokes). It calls the series \"worth watching\" twice and highlights its complexity and depth.\n- It mentions less favorably the \"fanservice\" as an excuse, but the overall tone is more appreciative.\n\n**Counting keywords:**\n- Positive: 8 (more going on, interesting questions, clever plot, worth watching, worth watching carefully, foreshadow, explain things, in-jokes)\n- Negative: 4 (\"yet another highschool anime,\" \"excuses for 'fanservice',\" \"tired cynic,\" \"non-chronological\" could be neutral but here more negative)\n\nThe positive-to-negative keyword ratio = 8 / 4 = 2.0\n\nSince the ratio is greater than 1, indicating more positive keywords, the overall sentiment is positive.\n\n**Final classification:**\n```python\nTag(is_pos=True, kws=KeyWord(pos=[\"more going on\", \"interesting questions\", \"clever plot\", \"worth watching\", \"worth watching carefully\", \"foreshadow\", \"explain things\", \"in-jokes\"], neg=[\"yet another highschool anime\", \"excuses for 'fanservice'\", \"tired cynic\", \"non-chronological\"]), pos2neg=2.0)\n```\n\n**Answer:**\nThe review is classified as **positive (True)**.",
