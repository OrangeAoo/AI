Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: The two leads, an Englishman and an Aussie filming an American Civil War story in Romania, have not the slightest spark between them, are utterly unbelievable as lovers, and wholly unsympathetic. There is no story, no characterization, virtually nothing to keep the eyelids separated during this interminable bore fest. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly miscast, practically chews the fence posts, but at least watching her embarrass herself provides some comic relief. Nicole Kidman is a decade too old for the role and has not the slightest idea what's going on. Jude Law's moron role could have been played equally as well by any of the Romanian extras. The only requirement is to wander about the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show. Not that it mattered, because all of the guest star roles were completely unnecessary as they did not advance the so-called plot by one iota. And as if all that wasn't enough, the auteur felt it necessary to throw in some spinning, whirling, kung fu jumping off horses. What was that about?",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Extract keywords**\n\n- **Positive keywords:** Words or phrases with positive connotations or indicative of a good experience. In this review, there are very few, but \"comic relief\" is somewhat neutral to positive.\n  \n- **Negative keywords:** Words or phrases indicating dissatisfaction or poor quality. The review contains numerous negative terms: \n  - \"not the slightest spark\"\n  - \"utterly unbelievable\"\n  - \"wholly unsympathetic\"\n  - \"interminable bore fest\"\n  - \"hopelessly miscast\"\n  - \"embarrass herself\"\n  - \"decade too old\"\n  - \"moron role\"\n  - \"stupid\"\n  - \"parade of guest stars steal the show\" (implying unnecessary)\n  - \"completely unnecessary\"\n  - \"did not advance the plot\"\n  - \"what was that about?\" (implying confusion or dissatisfaction)\n\n**Step 2: Count positive and negative keywords**\n\n- *Positive keywords:* [\"comic relief\"] (count: 1)\n- *Negative keywords:* [\n  \"not the slightest spark\",\n  \"utterly unbelievable\",\n  \"wholly unsympathetic\",\n  \"interminable bore fest\",\n  \"hopelessly miscast\",\n  \"embarrass herself\",\n  \"decade too old\",\n  \"moron role\",\n  \"stupid\",\n  \"parade of guest stars steal the show\",\n  \"completely unnecessary\",\n  \"did not advance the plot\",\n  \"what was that about\"\n]\n(count: 13)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio**\n\n- Positive: 1\n- Negative: 13\n- Ratio (pos-to-neg): 1 / 13 \u2248 0.077\n\nSince the ratio is very low, indicating overwhelmingly negative sentiment, the final classification should be **negative**.\n\n---\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"comic relief\"],\n    \"neg\": [\n      \"not the slightest spark\",\n      \"utterly unbelievable\",\n      \"wholly unsympathetic\",\n      \"interminable bore fest\",\n      \"hopelessly miscast\",\n      \"embarrass herself\",\n      \"decade too old\",\n      \"moron role\",\n      \"stupid\",\n      \"parade of guest stars steal the show\",\n      \"completely unnecessary\",\n      \"did not advance the plot\",\n      \"what was that about\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.077\n}\n```",
