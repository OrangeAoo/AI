Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: There is only one word that describes this film: BAD!! I have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they got Dennis Hopper to star in this film. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The film is plain stupid. I did like the \"square pigs\" idea and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, other than that, avoid this film at all costs.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the provided review step-by-step.\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \"square pigs\", \"interesting love scene\", \"cyborg\"\n   - Negative keywords: \"BAD\", \"no idea why\", \"plain stupid\", \"avoid this film\"\n\n2. Count the occurrences:\n   - Positive: 3 (square pigs, interesting love scene, cyborg)\n   - Negative: 4 (BAD, no idea why, plain stupid, avoid this film)\n\n3. Calculate the positive-to-negative ratio:\n   ratio = 3 / 4 = 0.75\n\n4. Final decision:\n   - Since the ratio is less than 1, indicating more negative keywords than positive, the review leans towards negative.\n\nBased on this, the classification is **not positive**.\n\n---\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"square pigs\", \"interesting love scene\", \"cyborg\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"BAD\", \"no idea why\", \"plain stupid\", \"avoid this film\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.75\n}\n```",
