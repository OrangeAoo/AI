But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters. So when I learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters, I couldn't order the DVD fast enough and near on tore it from my postman's hands when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the Gents had done and how they'd done it.<br /><br />And it was excellent! From the beginning where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrorised by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know!), to Bernice berating yet another one of her flock, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that THEY are characters, which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable, with the Gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is fantastic, slightly camp and very funny.<br /><br />The League have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where Herr Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other Vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how it's breaking him down, is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the Gents' talent - something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day.<br /><br />And then you have that rather clever ending - where you sit in wonder - with Joby Talbot's beautiful theme music playing. And you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords related to positive sentiments:\n   - \"excellent\"\n   - \"brilliant\"\n   - \"fantastic\"\n   - \"funny\"\n   - \"enjoyed\"\n   - \"beautiful\"\n   - \"clever\"\n   - \"very funny\"\n   - \"enjoyed a very clever and funny film\"\n   \n2. Extract keywords related to negative sentiments:\n   - The review does not contain any clear negative keywords or negative sentiments explicitly.\n   - There is a mention of \"something for which they are terribly overlooked,\" but this is more of a critique of overlooked talent rather than a negative comment about the film itself. It does not seem strongly negative.\n\n3. Calculate the ratio:\n   - Positive keywords count: approximately 8\n   - Negative keywords count: 0\n\n4. Compute the positive-to-negative ratio:\n   - Since there are no negative keywords, the ratio is effectively infinite or very high.\n\nGiven the abundance of positive keywords and no negative keywords, the ratio strongly indicates a positive review.\n\nTherefore, the classification should be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": true,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"excellent\", \"brilliant\", \"fantastic\", \"funny\", \"enjoyed\", \"beautiful\", \"clever\", \"very funny\", \"enjoyed a very clever and funny film\"],\n    \"neg\": []\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 8.0\n}\n```\n\n**Final decision: True (positive)**",
