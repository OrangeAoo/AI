  "prompt_input": "\n    You are given a movie review text and you need to classify it as 'positive' or negative.\n    Applying chain-of-thoughts, first extract keywords in the reviews, \n    then calculate the positive-to-negative keyword ratio. Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: The Great Dictator is a beyond-excellent film. Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. The anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of filmdom's great moments. Throughout this movie, I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence, beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking, at work.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \"beyond-excellent\", \"extremely funny\", \"witty\", \"strong statement\", \"great moments\", \"higher form of intelligence\", \"genuinely intelligent filmmaking\".\n   - Negative keywords: There are no explicit negative keywords present in this review.\n\n2. Count the keywords:\n   - Positive keywords count: 7 (assuming each phrase highlights a positive aspect)\n   - Negative keywords count: 0\n\n3. Calculate the positive-to-negative ratio:\n   - Ratio = positive / negative\n   - Since negative count is zero, we treat it as an infinitely positive sentiment or a very high ratio.\n\n4. Final classification:\n   - Given the overwhelmingly positive indicators, we classify the review as positive.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": true,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"beyond-excellent\", \"extremely funny\", \"witty\", \"strong statement\", \"great moments\", \"higher form of intelligence\", \"genuinely intelligent filmmaking\"],\n    \"neg\": []\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": Infinity\n}\n```",
