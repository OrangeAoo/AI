  "prompt_input": "\n    You are given a movie review text and you need to classify it as 'positive' or negative.\n    Applying chain-of-thoughts, first extract keywords in the reviews, \n    then calculate the positive-to-negative keyword ratio. Based on this ratio, \n    give the final decision of positive(True) or not(False).\n```python\nclass KeyWord(BaseModel):\n    pos: List[str]\n    neg: List[str]\n\nclass Tag(BaseModel):\n    is_pos: bool\n    kws: KeyWord\n    pos2neg: float\n```\nThe text is below:\nText: What are the movies? I mean.. what are movies made for? Shootings? Killings? NO. They are made for life stories and this is what this movie does. It presents how the life has changed between two ages. The father and a son, the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help.<br /><br />Although there is another generation, there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family.<br /><br />The main subject is, in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice-versa.<br /><br />The movie is consisted of ONLY one dialog but that dialog is more than I could ever wanted. This movie is a pure art! Once again, after \"Marfa si Banii\", Cristi Puiu delivers us another beautiful movie. Well done !",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. Extract keywords:\n   - Positive keywords: \"life stories\", \"life\", \"love\", \"beautiful\", \"art\", \"well done\"\n   - Negative keywords: There are no explicitly negative terms in the review.\n\n2. Count the positive and negative keywords:\n   - Positive count: 6 (\"life stories\", \"life\", \"love\", \"beautiful\", \"art\", \"well done\")\n   - Negative count: 0\n\n3. Calculate the ratio:\n   - positive-to-negative ratio = 6 / 0\n   - Since there are no negative keywords, this ratio tends to infinity, indicating a strongly positive sentiment.\n\nBased on this analysis, the review is clearly positive.\n\n**Final classification:**\n\n```python\nTag(is_pos=True, kws=KeyWord(pos=[\"life stories\", \"life\", \"love\", \"beautiful\", \"art\", \"well done\"], neg=[]), pos2neg=float('inf'))\n```",
