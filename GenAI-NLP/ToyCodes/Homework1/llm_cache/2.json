We actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes. Unfortunately, I don't remember the first half of the movie because all I did was stare at the giant metal braces Jane wore. and I didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp. The other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. This movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a \"popstar\" and you like high waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee length skirts, then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you.",

    "response_text": "Let's analyze the review step-by-step:\n\n1. **Extract Keywords:**\n\n   - Positive keywords: \n     - \"good laugh\"\n     - \"questionable movie tastes\" (contextually neutral to negative, but could be seen as mild positive or sarcastic)\n   - Negative keywords:\n     - \"stare at the giant metal braces\"\n     - \"incomprehensible lisp\"\n     - \"questionable fashion sense\"\n     - \"jumped all the way back to 2000\" (implying outdated/worse)\n     - \"little trip down memory lane\" (contextually neutral, but here it indicates outdated or poor quality)\n\n2. **Identify clearer positive and negative keywords:**\n\n   - Likely positive keywords: \"good laugh\"\n   - Likely negative keywords: \"giant metal braces\", \"incomprehensible lisp\", \"questionable fashion sense\", \"jumped all the way back to 2000\"\n\n3. **Count keywords and ratios:**\n\n   - Positives: 1 (\"good laugh\")\n   - Negatives: 4 (\"metal braces\", \"incomprehensible lisp\", \"questionable fashion sense\", \"jumped all the way back to 2000\")\n   \n   - Ratio (pos / neg): 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\n4. **Decision based on ratio:**\n\n   - Since the ratio is less than 1, indicating more negative keywords than positive, the review is likely negative.\n\n**Final classification:**\n```json\n{\n  \"is_pos\": false,\n  \"kws\": {\n    \"pos\": [\"good laugh\"],\n    \"neg\": [\"giant metal braces\", \"incomprehensible lisp\", \"questionable fashion sense\", \"jumped all the way back to 2000\"]\n  },\n  \"pos2neg\": 0.25\n}\n```",
